#### Henry Liu project 00
In this paper, we aims to demonstrate two planning algorithms that are based on different concepts. First algorithm is Weighted A*, which is the advanced version of A* algorithm, and also a common approach of Search-based planning algorithms. Original A* is composed of the Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm and a heuristic function. Compared to original A* algorithm, Weighted A* provides a more flexible restriction on the selection of a path. The result would be sub-optimal but the efficiency increases. 

The second algorithm is Rapidly Exploring Random Tree, or RRT. RRT is one of the most common Sample-based algorithm. RRT constructs a tree from random samples with root. The tree is grown until it contains a path to the goal. Since it generates a path according to the start position and the goal position, it is well-suited for single-shot planning. However, there are some disadvantages. The paths RRT computes may be sub-optimal and the path smoothing is required as a post-processing step. In addition, finding a feasible path in highly-constrained environment is challenging and expensive.

#### Our Proposal
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
